# 📊 Exploratory Correlation Analysis on Behavioral Data

## 📁 Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter/Colab notebook that demonstrates how daily habits such as coffee consumption, hours of TV watched, and other behaviors are statistically related to productivity and academic performance. Through correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, and coefficient of variation, we explore and interpret the nature and strength of these relationships.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation)
- Coefficient of variation
- Correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)
- Scatter plots, histograms, and line charts
- Impact of outliers on correlation
- Conceptual differences between correlation and causation

## 🧠 Conceptual Questions Answered

1. Difference between data science and data analytics  
2. Sensitivity of mean vs median to outliers  
3. Why correlation does not imply causation

## 📈 Datasets Used

The datasets were synthetically created to simulate:
- Coffee consumption vs. productivity scores
- TV watching hours vs. student grades
- Variable x vs. variable y (with and without outliers)

## 📦 Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

Install required packages (if not using Colab):
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
